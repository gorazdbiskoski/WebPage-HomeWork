                </div>
                <div class="g-text">
                    <p>I have been playing the guitar since elementary school.
                        The first and only guitar I got was for my birthday. Since then,
                        I started having private classes with my professor who helped me
                        immensely and helped me greatly to advance my ability to play the guitar.
                        I am a perfectionist, so at the start, every time I messed up I would get angry
                        and start playing the song from the beginning, I would do that every time until
                        I got it perfectly right. My professor even made a difficult to play song for me so
                        I would practice everyday until I got it perfect.</p>
                    <p>Nowadays I don't take up any private lessons, I just pick up my guitar now and then
                        just to remind myself how to play and for simply clearing my mind.</p>

                    <h4>Playing Video Games</h4>
                </div>
                <div class="vg-text">
                    <p>I would say that playing video games is the first hobby I had picked up.
                        I have been playing video games since I was a kid, even before kindergarten.
                        My brother introduced me to gaming, and the first game he introduced me to was
                        <span class="bold-text"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Counter-Strike">counter strike 1.6</a></span>,
                        and shortly after <span class="bold-text"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Grand_Theft_Auto:_San_Andreas">grand theft auto san andreas</a></span>.
                        Playing video games has always calmed me down in stressful situations. It is a space where you could meet new people
                        across the world and connect with them, although some people find video games dangerous of kids, I believe it is all a misconception.</p>
